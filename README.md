# miniCRM

Hit up a YAML editor and start with the initial Swagger Spec for an interface.

CRM API v1.0
Idea behind this is to define interfaces only - absolutely no implementation.

Taking a look at MSFT CDM - is just 1 such possibility.

UI components can be "plugged" into services at a later using a handy design pattern - coupled with a security model, where the rubber meets the road kind of thing.

_Unfortunately (but actually a great find) there is already an offering called microCRM.com  - I will keep the name microCRM for now - but acknowledge the domain and TM/IP is already in significant "play" - so will have to come up with another name at some point for the "mini" bundling of CRM, Accounts, Apps etc._
